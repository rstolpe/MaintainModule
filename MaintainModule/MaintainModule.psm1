Function Confirm-NeededModules {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Module that will let you in a easy way install or upgrade needed modules and also uninstall the old version of the modules.

        .DESCRIPTION
        This function will install specified modules if they are missing or upgrade them to the latest version if the modules already are installed.
        Option to delete all of the older versions of the modules and import the modules at the end does also exist.

        .PARAMETER NeededModules
        Here you can specify what modules you want to install and upgrade

        .PARAMETER ImportModules
        If this is used it will import all of the modules in the end of the script

        .PARAMETER DeleteOldVersion
        When this is used it will delete all of the older versions of the module after upgrading the module

        .PARAMETER OnlyUpgrade
        When this is used the script will not install any modules it will upgrade all of the already installed modules on the computer to the latest version.

        .EXAMPLE
        # This will check so PowerCLI and ImportExcel is installd and up to date, it not it will install them or upgrade them to the latest version and then delete all of the old versions and import the modules.
        Confirm-NeededModules -NeededModules "PowerCLI,ImportExcel" -ImportModules -DeleteOldVersion

        .EXAMPLE
        # This will only install PowerCli if it's not installed and upgrade it if needed. This example will not delete the old versions of PowerCli or import the module at the end.
        Confirm-NeededModules -NeededModules "PowerCLI"

        .EXAMPLE
        # This will only upgrade PowerCLI module
        Confirm-NeededModules -NeededModules "PowerCLI" -OnlyUpgrade

        .EXAMPLE
        # This will upgrade all of the already installed modules on the computer to the latest version
        Confirm-NeededModules -OnlyUpgrade

        .EXAMPLE
        # This will upgrade all of the already installed modules on the computer to the latest version and delete all of the old versions after
        Confirm-NeededModules -OnlyUpgrade -DeleteOldVersion
